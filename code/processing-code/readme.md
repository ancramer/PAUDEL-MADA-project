# processing-code

CAUTION: _Do NOT TRY TO RENDER THE FILE unless you have a powerful computer, run the codes by going through individual chunks instead._


This folder contains code for processing data.

The `processingfile-v1.qmd` file in this folder uses the raw data from the `data` `>` `raw-data` folder, and prepares a processed data that can be used for our analysis and eda process.

There is no `processingfile-v1.html` in this folder as my computer could not render it.

The processed data is saved in the `data` `>` `processed-data` folder as `processeddata.rds` and `processeddata.xlsx`.


Run the `processingfile-v1.qmd` file, it will generate a dataset named `processeddata` in folder `data`.
_NOTE: Due to the structure of the dataset and processing technique used in the codes, your computer might take a significant time in processing the code specially in the *Data Transformation* section as 641,817 observations are created during the process. I would recommend you to just wait patiently when you run the codes from this section. It may take upto few minutes depending on the speed of your computer.(Trying to use the computer while the codes are running may FREEZE your computer.)_
