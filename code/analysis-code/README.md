# analysis-code


This folder contains the `statistical-analysis.qmq` file which has the code for running all our basic to advanced analysis of the project.
The analysis code from this folder depends on the processed data generated from the `processing-code` folder.

The `statistical-analysis.html` file contains the output generated from the `statistical-analysis.qmq` code in a html format.

Some tables are saved as figures because of some technical complications.
